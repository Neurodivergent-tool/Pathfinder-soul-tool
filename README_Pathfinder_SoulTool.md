## What It Is

**Pathfinder** is a modular, self-guided support system for high-masking, memory-challenged, neurodivergent individuals — designed to feel like a mirror, not a management tool.

Not just for symptom tracking — but for remembering who you are when everything falls apart.

## Why It’s Different

Most apps either:

- Focus on one thing (mood tracker, habit builder)  
- Overwhelm with features  
- Feel like they’re built by people who don’t actually *need* them  

**Pathfinder is different because:**

- It adapts to your state (low energy, high flow, recovery mode)  
- Combines physical, mental, emotional, and soul patterns into one view  
- Supports the human, not just the diagnosis
